# Plant Disease Detection API

This FastAPI-based API serves a quantized PyTorch model (EfficientNet-B0) for plant disease detection. The model can classify images of plants into 66 different classes, helping users identify diseases and conditions in their plants.

## üöÄ Getting Started

To get started with the Plant Disease Detection API, follow the steps below to set up and run the server.

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Salman-Farid/plant_disease_detection.git
cd plant_disease_detection
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Set Environment Variables

Before running the server, ensure you have the `MODEL_PATH` environment variable set, which points to your trained model.

```bash
export MODEL_PATH="./data_file/efficientnet_b0_plant_modelarc.pth"
```

### 4. Run the API Server

```bash
uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 2828
```

The API server will now be running at [http://localhost:2828](http://localhost:2828).

## üßë‚Äçüî¨ API Endpoints

### 1. **POST** `/predict/`

This endpoint accepts an image file and returns a prediction for the plant disease.

#### Request

- **Method**: POST
- **Endpoint**: `/predict/`
- **Parameters**: 
    - **file**: A plant image (JPEG/PNG format) for diagnosis.

#### Example Request

```bash
curl -X 'POST' \
  'http://localhost:2828/predict/' \
  -H 'accept: application/json' \
  -H 'Content-Type: multipart/form-data' \
  -F 'file=@your_image_path.jpg'
```

#### Response

- **Prediction**: Returns a string representing the plant disease or condition.

```json
{
  "prediction": "Bitter gourd - Downy Mildew"
}
```
